## Features


- Monitoring of AQI and WQI through sensors 
- Advanced and easy AQI monitoring
- Realtime AQI status of various cities shown on the map
- Future prediction of AQI and WQI with the pollutantâ€™s concentration through AI/ML 
- Based on the present as well as the future predicted values of AQI, the probable sites for plantation can be proposed
- With the proposed WQI detection scheme, samples of drinking water in a particular area will be monitored through image processing/sensors and based on the results suggestions/alerts to the concern authority will be delivered
